# Sulphur Dioxide over Europe

### 1 - Introduction
Sulphur Dioxide emissions reached a concerningly high level across Europe during the 1980’s, and as a result new laws were passed in the 1990’s in order to control this. This section of the report will analyse data from the ‘European monitoring and evaluating program’ which monitored SO2 levels at various stations across Europe from 1990 to 2001. These sites can be seen in Figure 1.

Figure 2: A scatterplot showing the levels of SO2 pollution in each year. A logarithm transformation has been applied to the SO2 variable.

Figure 2 shows a plot of the SO2 levels across the years. A logarithm transformation has been applied to the SO2 variable to enhance clarity. Without this all the points were clustered together at one side of the graph and could not be easily interpreted. By applying this transformation, it is easier to identify relationships within the data.

### 3 - Site Plots

Figure 3: Three scatterplots showing the levels of SO2 pollution in each year at three separate stations. FR11, GB04 and HU02 represent station is France, Great Britain and Hungary respectively.

Using Figure 3 and focusing on the plot for France, we immediately notice there is less data than the other two plots. There is no data from 1998 onwards. There was a decrease in emissions around 1993, however the emissions seem to be fairly sporadic in highs and lows. There are obvious outliers around the beginning of 1997, which are very high. 

Next, looking at the Great Britain plot, we see a more linear pattern. Emissions appear to be reducing at a fairly constant rate with peaks towards the end of each year. This represents a seasonal pattern within the emissions. Overall, the data for Great Britain follows a far clearer pattern compared to that of France. There is a noticeable gap around 1993-94 where no data was collected.

Finally, the Hungary plot follows a similar pattern to Great Britain but the plots are less tightly grouped. The data followed a loose pattern in the early 1990’s, again showing a seasonal peak at the end of a year. We observe a gap in the data around 1996, before resuming to a stronger version of the pattern seen in previous years. This implies that emissions were much better controlled in the latter half of the 1990’s onwards. Despite this stronger pattern, Figure 3 demonstrates that, on average, the emission rates are higher than before.

### 4 - Conclusions
Looking at the overall shape of Figure 2, we know that SO2 emissions are slowly decreasing across Europe, with very few outliers. The wave shape as observed in Figure 3 is also apparent in Figure 2, implying that this peak in emission at the end of the year is seen across the majority of stations in Europe.
