# Sulphur Dioxide over Europe

### 1 - Introduction
Sulphur Dioxide emissions reached a concerningly high level across Europe during the 1980’s, and as a result new laws were passed in the 1990’s in order to control this. This section of the report will analyse data from the ‘European monitoring and evaluating program’ which monitored SO2 levels at various stations across Europe from 1990 to 2001. These sites can be seen in Figure 1.

Figure 2: A scatterplot showing the levels of SO2 pollution in each year. A logarithm transformation has been applied to the SO2 variable.

Figure 2 shows a plot of the SO2 levels across the years. A logarithm transformation has been applied to the SO2 variable to enhance clarity. Without this all the points were clustered together at one side of the graph and could not be easily interpreted. By applying this transformation, it is easier to identify relationships within the data.
