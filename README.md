Figure 1: Map of SO2 monitoring stations across Europe.

Sulphur Dioxide emissions reached a concerningly high level across Europe during the 1980’s, and as a result new laws were passed in the 1990’s in order to control this. This section of the report will analyse data from the ‘European monitoring and evaluating program’ which monitored SO2 levels at various stations across Europe from 1990 to 2001. These sites can be seen in Figure 1.
